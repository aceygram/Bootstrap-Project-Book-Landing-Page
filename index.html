                        <p class="mb-2">This book does not dissapoint if you reasonate with any of my Trump fandom. It gives you insight into his character and what motivates him. From reading this book you will learn what it means to be successful and how to adopt the mindset necessary for victory. I realize that all those slanderous mishaps that he made during the election were actually well explained within this book. To Donald Trump, it was important that he put those who would screw him over back in line. He compares these people to bullies from school who would only stop bullying if you hit them back just as hard or even harder.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Not late though, you are never late to read this book. I have had many customers, I have known some very successful customers, and they share some qualities with Donald Trump: they never stop working, they take falls and hardships as intervals, they don't let themselves to demoralize by attacks of rivals with interests in watching them fall, they get wives or husbands that push them upwards, they demand dreams, some are even called crazy but their craziness materializes into towers that dominate their cities.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">I didn't know who Donald Trump was other than assuming he was an egomaniac millionaire. And then I saw a short presidential candidacy interview of him and wanted to know more about his beliefs- because he sounded right on. This book was written in 2008 and I thought that would give me an accurate idea of where his values are. But, I thought I'd be throwing away my $18.99 for the book because I'm more of a mouse thinker. Am about zen and creativity, survival-ism and am simply not a business person at all. A bullet dodger. I was pleasantly surprised to recognize a lot of truths in this book. I highlighted many passages.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Thanks to 'The Apprentice USA', Donald Trump has re-emerged as a major figure within 21st century pop culture. It is easy to mock him. But reading this series of self-improvement books really does gives us wonderful insights in to what separates the mind of a multi-billionaire from the rest of the 7 billion people on this planet. As the title says, it is all about coming up with the big ideas and dreams. And then, doing all you can to realise them. Life really is brief. So, why think along small steps? This is the thinking behind Donald Trump.</p>
